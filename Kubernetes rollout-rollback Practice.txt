Rollout and Rollback
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Testing Rollout Feature in Kubernetes
-----------------------------------------------------
1. First, create a file using nano rollout.yml with nginx image and paste service and deployment yaml inside it.
2.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: rollout
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: rollout
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: rollout
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: rollout
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: rollout
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
3. Deploy deployment and service files  using following command
4. kubectl apply -f rollout.yml
5. Run the following commands to check that all pods are running.
6. kubectl get deployments
7. Run the following command to view the rollout history
8. kubectl rollout history deployment rollout
9. Run the following command to annotate the change-cause column.
10. kubectl annotate deployment rollout kubernetes.io/change-cause="nginx:latest deployment"
11. Again run the command provided in step 8 to view the rollout history. You should see the status annotated to the one set in step 10.
12. Next edit the rollout.yml created in step 2 with container image of "httpd:latest" and save it.
13. Run the following commands to update the deployment.
14. kubectl apply -f rollout.yml
15. Run the following command to view the rollout history
16. kubectl rollout history deployment rollout
17. Now, you should see that there are two versions of the deployments, first one with nginx deployment and second with httpd deployment.
18. Run the following command to annotate the change-cause column.
19. kubectl annotate deployment rollout kubernetes.io/change-cause="httpd:latest deployment"
20. Run the command provided in step 16 to view the rollout history. You should see the status annotated to the one set in step 19.
21. Run minikube service rollout command given below to get the url and verfiy httpd server is running.
22. minikube service rollout --url

Testing Rollback Feature in Kubernetes
-----------------------------------------------------
1. Run the following command to rollback to the nginx deployment.
2. kubectl rollout undo deployment rollout.
3. Run the following command to view the rollout history
4. kubectl rollout history deployment rollout
5. It should add revision in the history with ID 3 and remove revision 1 from the history 
6. View the url of the service again to find out that deployment has successfully rolled out to nginx deployment.
7. In the similar way, if there are more than 6 deployments rolled out and you want to rollback to 4th revision, then use following command.
8. kubectl rollout undo deployment --to-revision=4  
9. Create different images of yourproject with varied features and try rollout and rollback features for your own application.
